## Conclusion

UnifiedAI's architecture is **inspired by** Scale AI's proven approach but **adapted for** a different market need:

**Scale AI:** "We'll prepare perfect training data and build custom models for you"

**UnifiedAI:** "We'll unify your existing data and intelligently route to the best available models"

Both approaches are valid. Both are necessary. They solve different problems for different customers at different stages of their AI journey.

Our goal is to **learn from Scale's excellence** while **serving a distinct market** with **complementary technology**.
